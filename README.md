# Data-Science-Project
This is a personal project I'm working, which uses the R coding language to analyze the correlation between increased level in exercise to a higher performance in studying. This project was assisted at the hands of one of my bootcamp instructors from 2020,
Jacob Dougherty. Please contact him via his LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-dougherty-b9a066156/
